            within the Larry H. Miller Automotive group. I work with website design, website UI/UX, SEO, 
            analytics/tracking and Google Optimize. I previously was a Senior Digital Specialist for a 
            Social-Media firm in Riverton Utah. There I managed and implemented social media strategy for 
            dozens of e-commerce companies. This is my passion and I love learning 
            how to improve my craft every day! I am born and raised in the DFW area. I went to school at BYU and I lived in
            Brazil for two years. I can speak Portuguese fluently and I can also speak Spanish very well.  </p>
